The LL program has several specific triggers for the process. The first
is the submission of a final report and briefing on a program. This
triggers the scheduling of an interview with the program test director,
and distribution of the interview worksheet (Appendix B). The second
trigger is the departure of a test director from the organization.
Either by self-report or otherwise, the Lessons Learned manager
schedules an interview with the test director, as their timeline allows.
When a test director or team member schedules an interview, they are
given at least one weeks' notice to compile their thoughts, and then sit
down for an interview with the Lessons Learned manager. During this
meeting the LL manager explores and discusses the issues and novel
solutions the test team member experienced during the test program.
These notes and any specific observations captured are then crafted into
Observations for review. The third trigger is self-submission of
Observations through the internal AFOTEC SharePoint site. Finally,
annual "Drivers Surveys" will be used to record the problems most
impeding our member's accomplishment of their duties and can be used to
draft observations to initiate the next phase.
