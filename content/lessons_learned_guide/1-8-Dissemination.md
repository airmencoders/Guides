Once a "Lesson Identified" is found by the LL team, it must be assigned
an action officer. This action officer is given the task of developing
the actions necessary to incorporate the LI into the organization. These
actions are highly dependent on the individual LI, and will have to
adjust to the unique requirements of each LI.

Once implementation actions are identified, the action officer will need
to regularly report on progress towards completion and keep the LL
manager apprised of changes. The final goal of this process will be to
have each of these LL incorporated into training, the OT&E guide, or
OTIFs as appropriate; they will not exist within some stand-alone
database of test advice.
