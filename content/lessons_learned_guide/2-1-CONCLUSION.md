It is the place of every member of our organization to ensure AFOTEC
continues to learn and adapt. We must give our organization every
opportunity to respond to new challenges in the DoD acquisition
environment however they arise, be it policy, funding, or global
situations. This process is one of the steps being taken to support our
combined efforts to face and learn from the challenges of our mission,
and depends on our partners across the AFOTEC enterprise and their
willingness to participate to support this endeavor.

The AFOTEC Lessons Learned process is owned by A-2/9, and staffed by
members of A-9O. Any questions, comments, or suggestions for improvement
can be directed to this office.
