The goal of this guide is to provide an introduction to the AFOTEC
Lessons Learned (LL) process, explain the importance of the LL effort,
and finally show where this process is tied to established policy and
guidance. This process is mandated by AFI 10-1302, but the
implementation and usefulness of this effort is dependent on the
willingness of the organization to consider and develop valuable inputs
to the program. The previous iteration of this process relied on a
"push" from Test Directors at the close-out of programs and would be
presented during the final briefing to the Commander. Lessons Learned
can and should be produced at any point in a program lifecycle, but will
now have a dedicated end of program event to discuss and collect
observations. Lastly, Lessons Learned is just one aspect of AFOTEC's
commitment to continuous process improvement, and the increases in
effectiveness and efficiency that come of that active institutional
feedback.

It is the expectation that this guide will provide clarification of the
process that AFOTEC uses to collect, track, and disseminate and
implement LL. This guide will serve as a reference for when and who to
contact to submit identified lessons for evaluation and what to expect
after submitting a proposed LL.
