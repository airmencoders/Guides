As interviews are accomplished, or observations are submitted, the LL
Manager and division chief will sort through and initiate a disposition
of each observation. These observations will be reviewed with the
assistance of any pertinent experts or necessary process owners. If the
observation is determined to be valid, the Observation becomes a Lesson
Identified (LI), and proceeds to the next step. If the Observation is
deemed invalid, the LL manager will craft a response to the submitter
detailing why it was deemed invalid, and give the TD the chance to
further elaborate if they think the decision was reached with incomplete
information or understanding.
