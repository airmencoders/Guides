# About

AFOTEC Team,

Last Spring, we undertook an effort to evolve our OT&E guidance to be less prescriptive, match what we were doing, and provide the tools to test teams to deliver combat capability.  At the core of this effort was enabling the six principles of Adaptive, Relevant Testing.  We have been on a journey to transform our core documentation, the OT&E Guide, into a mobile friendly app that makes use of the best the web has to offer.

This site is still in beta, but is regularly updated with all the same data from the AFOTEC Sharepoint site.  While we’re still experimenting with the format, if there’s an instance of informational discrepancy between sites, Sharepoint is the authoritative source.

Application features include:
- Mobile and desktop views
- Searchable across all documents with a scrollable table of contents that is always visible (desktop view)
- Pop-up definitions of acronyms (desktop view)
- Dark/Light reading experiences


The new guide is a living and breathing document.  Rather than performing an update every other year, the new guide will incorporate updates at any point.  To keep the Guide up to date and meaningful, we need content from you.  

You can submit content through email to the [Guide Team](mailto:Kirtland.AFOTEC.A5.Workflow@us.af.mil) and [App Team](mailto:travis.smith.3@us.af.mil), such as:

- Information for specific guides related to your job duties to create living continuity constructs
- Tools and how-to methods for achieving certain aspects of your job
- Templates for reports and other deliverables, along with step-by-step instructions
- Contacts related to your job, to populate an always-current list
- Web Application features you’d like to see

This is but one small part of transforming AFOTEC for relevance in 2030. The new tools will allow AFOTEC’s best ideas and most current information to move through the organization in an always current, dynamic fashion.
