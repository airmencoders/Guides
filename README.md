# Guides

This is the future home of a generalized project that would allow orgs to create a web app that displays their guidance documentation (provided it is not classified / uncontrolled info).

The goal is to make it easy for your people to read relevant guidance for their jobs anywhere:  work, home, and on mobile.

Stack:  JS, HTML, CSS.  A React project, it is totally front end/client side, with the exception of a few dependencies and python code for document prep.

It is based on an effort at AFOTEC, but can't be shared until the project is abstracted from that specific use case.  Stand by.
